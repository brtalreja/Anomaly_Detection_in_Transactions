# Anomaly Detection in Transactions

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in transaction data to identify potential fraudulent activities. The dataset consists of various transactional attributes such as `Transaction_Amount`, `Account_Type`, `Age`, and many more. By utilizing machine learning techniques like **Isolation Forest** and **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**, I tried to classify transactions as either normal or anomalous. Additionally, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer behavior, spending patterns, and potential anomalies.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
### Transaction Amount Distribution: To identify the normal spending range and potential outliers

### Transaction Amount vs Account Type: To compare transaction amounts across `Savings` and `Current` accounts.
