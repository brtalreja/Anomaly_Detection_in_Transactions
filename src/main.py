#Transaction Amount Distribution

fig_amount = px.histogram(data,
                          x = 'Transaction_Amount',
                          nbins=20,

fig_amount.write_image("../output/Transaction_Amount_Distribution.png")

#COMMENTS:
# The plot shows a highly right-skewed distribution where the majority of transactions are concentrated between 850 and 1050.
# There are a few outliers visible in the higher transaction range, specifically in the 2500â€“3000+ range which could represent anomalies and in turn indicate potential anomalies like fraud.
# As the range of transactions is in between 850 and 1100, it can be a typical spending pattern or a standard transactional limit.

#Transaction Amount vs Account Type

fig_box_amount = px.box(data,
                        x = 'Account_Type',
                        y = 'Transaction_Amount',

fig_box_amount.write_image("../output/Transaction_amount_vs_Account_type.png")

#COMMENTS:
# The median transaction amount for both Savings and Current account types appears to be around 1000.
# Also, both the account types exhibit a similar interquartile range (IQR), meaning that the majority of transactions fall within the range 950 to 1050 for both Savings and Current accounts.
# Both Savings and Current accounts have a notable number of outliers with transaction amounts exceeding 2500. These high-value transactions are infrequent but can be seen in both types of accounts.
# These outliers may indicate high-spending customers or potentially anomalous behavior that warrants further investigation. 

# Average Transaction Amount by Age

fig_scatter_amount = px.scatter(data,
                                x = "Age",
                                y = "Average_Transaction_Amount",
                                color = "Account_Type",
                                title = "Average Transaction Amount by Age",
                                trendline="ols")

fig_scatter_amount.show()

fig_scatter_amount.write_image("../output/Average_Transaction_amount_by_Age.png")

#COMMENTS:
# There is no significant increase or decrease in the average transaction amount as age progresses, indicating that age may not be a primary determinant of how much individuals are transacting on average.
# Both savings and current accounts display a similar range of average transaction amounts, suggesting that account type does not drastically affect average spending behavior.
# There are a few outliers at the lower end of the transaction amounts for older individuals (age 60+) in both account types, indicating occasional lower transaction averages for this age group.
# The trendline for both account types is relatively flat, thus concreting the observation that the average transaction amount does not show significant variation with age.

# Number of Transactions by the days of the week

                              category_orders={"Day_of_Week": day_order})

fig_bar_transactions.show()

fig_bar_transactions.write_image("../output/Number_of_transactions_by_Days.png")

#COMMENTS:
# Tuesday records the highest number of transactions, suggesting a possible trend in user behavior where more people engage in transactions early in the work week.
# Both Monday and Saturday show a slightly lower number of transactions compared to the mid-week, which could indicate that customers engage less in financial transactions at the start of the week or during the weekend.
# There is no significant drop-off or peak towards the end of the work week (Wednesday to Friday), which indicates a balanced distribution of transactional activity.
