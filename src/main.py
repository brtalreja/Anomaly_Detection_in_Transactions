#COMMENTS:
# The plot shows a highly right-skewed distribution where the majority of transactions are concentrated between 850 and 1050.
# There are a few outliers visible in the higher transaction range, specifically in the 2500â€“3000+ range which could represent anomalies and in turn indicate potential anomalies like fraud.
# As the range of transactions is in between 850 and 1100, it can be a typical spending pattern or a standard transactional limit.

#Transaction Amount vs Account Type

#COMMENTS:
# The median transaction amount for both Savings and Current account types appears to be around 1000.
# Also, both the account types exhibit a similar interquartile range (IQR), meaning that the majority of transactions fall within the range 950 to 1050 for both Savings and Current accounts.
# Both Savings and Current accounts have a notable number of outliers with transaction amounts exceeding 2500. These high-value transactions are infrequent but can be seen in both types of accounts.
# These outliers may indicate high-spending customers or potentially anomalous behavior that warrants further investigation.
